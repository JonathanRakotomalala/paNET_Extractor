Though the ES of these 2D LHPs show prospect of facilitating photovoltaic and optoelectronic effects, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, the occurrence of ES in a family of 2D A<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>PbBr<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> (A = organic amine cation) LHPs is attributed to the Rashba/Dresselhaus (RD) spin splitting induced\u00a0by local structural reorganization on the crystal edge. The experimental and theoretical characterizations reveal that the local structure on the crystal edge is significantly strained, which leads to considerable out\u2010of\u2010plane distortion of adjacent PbBr<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> octahedra, local loss of inversion symmetry and therefore spin\u2010splitting energy required for the formation of ES. This findings contribute fresh perspectives to the fundamental comprehension of the RD effect, extending the boundaries of spintronics and opening promising pathways for the conceptualization and refinement of devices centered on ES.</jats:p>", "techniques": {"output": [{"inText": "XANES", "inPaNET": {"technique": {"label": "x-ray absorption near edge structure", "altLabel": ["NEXAFS", "XANES"], "subClassOf": {"PaNET00402": "obtain electronic ground state properties", "PaNET01197": "x-ray absorption fine structure"}, "definition1": "", "definition2": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_absorption_near_edge_structure"}}}, {"inText": "SAXS", "inPaNET": {"technique": {"label": "small angle x-ray scattering", "altLabel": ["SAXS"], "subClassOf": {"PaNET01012": "x-ray probe", "PaNET01124": "small angle scattering"}, "definition1": "", "definition2": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-angle_X-ray_scattering"}}}]}}]}
