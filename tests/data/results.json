            "abstract": "<jats:p>Fluorapatite (FAp, nominally Ca10(PO4)6F2) has been identified as an important host-material for rare earth elements and yttrium (REY) in marine sediments. REY can be accommodated in either the larger 6+3 coordinated Ca1 site or the smaller 6+1 coordinated Ca2 site, yet little is known about the site preference of REY through the lanthanide series despite its importance for understanding REY enrichment processes in FAp. Theoretical investigations based on density functional theory (DFT) predict that all REY intrinsically prefer the smaller and more ionic Ca2 site. The Ca2 site preference is less pronounced when the excess of positive charge resulting from the REY3+ for Ca2+ substitution is compensated by a coupled Na+ for Ca2+ substitution, instead of the energetically more favorable Si4+ for P5+ coupled substitution. The site preference varies quadratically with the ionic radius of REY and linearly with the sum of their first and second ionization energies. The quadratic shape of the site preference is similar to the shape of Onuma diagrams, which suggests that the local effective elastic constant of the site controls the site preference, rather than the nominal size of the site. Despite being smaller, the Ca2 site has a lower effective elastic constant, and is, therefore, more flexible than the Ca1 site for accommodating larger and smaller trivalent REY cations. Concentration-dependent computations show that REY clustering is thermodynamically favorable, except for Yb and Lu.</jats:p>",

Their viral cycle has been studied and characterized over decades and they are nowadays considered as invaluable biotechnology tools widely used as biopesticides, recombinant expression systems or delivery vehicle for gene therapy. However, very little is known about the baculovirus nucleocapsid assembly at a molecular level. Here, we solved the whole structure of the nucleocapsid of<jats:italic>Autographa californica</jats:italic>multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) by applying cryo-electron microscopy (CryoEM) combined to<jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic>modelling and Alphafold2 predictions. Our structure completes prior observations from the helical sheath and the basal structure and elucidate the intricate architecture of the apical cap, unravelling for the first time the organization of a baculoviral DNA portal featuring intriguing symmetry mismatches between its core and vertex. The core, closing the capsid at the apex, holds two antiparallel DNA helices of the covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA genome tethered to Ac54 proteins. Different symmetry components at the apical cap and basal structure are constituted of the same building block, made of Ac101/Ac144, proving the versatility of this modular pair. The crown forming the portal vertex displays a C21 symmetry and contains, amongst others, the motor-like protein Ac66. Our findings support the viral portal to be involved in DNA packaging, most probably in conjunction with other parts of a larger DNA packaging apparatus that are not bound to mature virions and await further elucidation.</jats:p>",

            "abstract": "Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus depend on its ability to acquire nutrients. One essential nutrient is iron, which is obtained from the heme of the human host hemoglobin (Hb) through a protein machinery called Iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd)\u00a0system. IsdB is the protein in charge of heme extraction from Hb, which is the first step of the chain of events leading to iron transfer to the bacterium cell interior. In order to elucidate the molecular events leading from the formation of the initial IsdB:Hb complex to heme extraction, we use time-resolved X-ray solution scattering (TR-XSS) in combination with rapid mixing triggering. We succeed in defining the stoichiometry of IsdB:Hb binding and in describing the kinetics of the subsequent structural changes. The presented approach is potentially applicable to unveil the complex kinetic pathways generated by protein-protein interaction in different biological systems.",
