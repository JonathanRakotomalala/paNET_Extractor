{"outputs": [{"doi": "10.1021/acs.chemmater.4c02989", "abstract": "Using molten salts for etching aluminum (Al) away from the MAX phase for MXene synthesis is an attractive alternative method that allows one to avoid the use of toxic hydrofluoric acid (HF) solutions. However, the mechanism of the MAX phase reaction with molten salts remains to date unclear due to the lack of in situ data. Here, we present a detailed in situ time-resolved synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction study of the MAX phase annealing in molten ZnCl2 and SnCl2. The reaction of salts with the MAX phase is found to occur in two stages. The initial period of annealing results in the delamination of two-dimensional (2D) Ti3C2 layers, vigorous evolution of AlCl3 bubbles, and dissolution of Zn in a ZnCl2 melt. The chlorine-terminated Ti3C2 sheets formed in the delaminated state are restacked into a relatively well-ordered MXene structure (P63/mmc, a = 3.071 \u00c5 and c = 18.577 \u00c5) during the prolonged annealing in molten salts. Surprisingly, the data recorded directly in molten salts at temperatures up to 873 K demonstrate that Ti3C2Clx MXene shows no swelling in both liquid ZnCl2 and SnCl2. The structure of MXene studied directly in the molten salts is found to be the same as in ex situ experiments performed after cooling and water washing under ambient conditions. The absence of the \u201cpristine\u201d melt-swollen phase indicates a rather different mechanism of MXene formation compared to HF-based solution methods. Formation of MXene by gradually removing Al from the MAX phase starting at the edges of flakes and propagating into the deeper parts of interlayers is not possible, since the molten salt is not capable of penetrating between Cl-terminated Ti3C2 layers.", "techniques": {"output": [{"inText": "SAXS", "inPaNET": {"technique": {"label": "small angle x-ray scattering", "altLabel": ["SAXS"], "subClassOf": {"PaNET01012": "x-ray probe", "PaNET01124": "small angle scattering"}, "definition1": "", "definition2": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-angle_X-ray_scattering"}}}, {"inText": "XANES", "inPaNET": {"technique": {"label": "x-ray absorption near edge structure", "altLabel": ["NEXAFS", "XANES"], "subClassOf": {"PaNET00402": "obtain electronic ground state properties", "PaNET01197": "x-ray absorption fine structure"}, "definition1": "", "definition2": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_absorption_near_edge_structure"}}}, {"inText": "X-ray diffraction tomography", "inPaNET": {"technique": {"label": "x-ray refraction tomography", "altLabel": [], "subClassOf": {"PaNET01012": "x-ray probe", "PaNET01152": "propagation phase contrast tomography"}, "definition1": "", "definition2": ""}}}, {"inText": "in situ time-resolved synchrotron radiation", "inPaNET": {"technique": {"label": "time dependent diffraction", "altLabel": ["time resolved diffraction"], "subClassOf": {"CHMO_0000182": "", "PaNET01022": "diffraction", "PaNET01263": "time dependent scattering", "Q133900": ""}, "definition1": "", "definition2": ""}}}]}}, {"doi": "10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-bmtmq", "abstract": "<jats:p>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are highly effective broad-spectrum antibiotics, found as components of the immune system in almost all forms of life. It is well established that their primary target is the cell membrane where they are hypothesized to permeabilize the bilayer. However, it is a long-standing question whether stable transmembrane and structural pores are necessary, or if the peptides permeabilize the membrane through transient channels. Here this question is addressed with simultaneous characterization of the membrane structure, peptide partitioning, and ion transport in real time, using timeresolved small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (TR-SAXS and TR-SANS). These experiments reveal that even unstructured and non-penetrating AMPs can rapidly permeabilize the membrane, with complete ion equilibration occurring in only a few tens of milliseconds. Fully-atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that the peripherally bound peptides disrupt the lipid packing and cause an increased flip-flop rate which results in transient aqueous pores. A diffusion model based on these transient pores is developed and fitted to the experimentally measured kinetics, showing excellent correlation between experiment and theory. This label-free approach, with millisecond time resolution, demonstrates that structural pores are not required and represents a significant step toward illuminating the much-debated molecular mechanisms of AMPs.</jats:p>", "techniques": {"output": [{"inText": "SAXS", "inPaNET": {"technique": {"label": "small angle x-ray scattering", "altLabel": ["SAXS"], "subClassOf": {"PaNET01012": "x-ray probe", "PaNET01124": "small angle scattering"}, "definition1": "", "definition2": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-angle_X-ray_scattering"}}}, {"inText": "XANES", "inPaNET": {"technique": {"label": "x-ray absorption near edge structure", "altLabel": ["NEXAFS", "XANES"], "subClassOf": {"PaNET00402": "obtain electronic ground state properties", "PaNET01197": "x-ray absorption fine structure"}, "definition1": "", "definition2": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_absorption_near_edge_structure"}}}, {"inText": "TR-SAXS", "inPaNET": {"technique": {"label": "time resolved serial femtosecond crystallography", "altLabel": ["TR-SFX"], "subClassOf": {"PaNET01168": "serial femtosecond crystallography", "PaNET01264": "time dependent diffraction"}, "definition1": "", "definition2": ""}}}, {"inText": "TR-SANS", "inPaNET": {"technique": {"label": "small angle neutron scattering", "altLabel": ["SANS"], "subClassOf": {"PaNET01124": "small angle scattering", "PaNET01217": "neutron diffraction"}, "definition1": "", "definition2": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-angle_neutron_scattering"}}}, {"inText": "Molecular Dynamics (MD)", "inPaNET": {"technique": {"label": "molecular replacement", "altLabel": ["MR"], "subClassOf": {"PaNET01164": "macromolecular crystallography"}, "definition1": "", "definition2": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_replacement"}}}]}}, {"doi": "10.1107/s2052252525004130", "abstract": "<jats:p>Icosahedrite, natural icosahedral Al<jats:sub>63</jats:sub>Cu<jats:sub>24</jats:sub>Fe<jats:sub>13</jats:sub>, was discovered in a meteorite about 15 years ago.
