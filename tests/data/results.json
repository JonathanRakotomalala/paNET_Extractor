In this work, we report a highly active and stable ceria (CeO             <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>             )-based electronically tuned trimetallic catalyst for CO             <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>             to CO conversion. A unique distribution of electron density between the defective ceria support and the trimetallic nanoparticles (of Ni, Cu, Zn) was established by creating the strong metal support interaction (SMSI) between them. The catalyst showed CO productivity of 49,279 mmol g             <jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>             h             <jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>             at 650 \u00b0C. CO selectivity up to 99% and excellent stability (rate remained unchanged even after 100 h) stemmed from the synergistic interactions among Ni-Cu-Zn sites and their SMSI with the defective ceria support. High-energy-resolution fluorescence-detection X-ray absorption spectroscopy (HERFD-XAS) confirmed this SMSI, further corroborated by in situ electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations. The in situ studies (HERFD-XAS &amp; EELS) indicated the key role of oxygen vacancies of defective CeO             <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>             during catalysis. The in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging under catalytic conditions visualized the movement and growth of active trimetallic sites, which completely stopped once SMSI was established. In situ FTIR (supported by DFT) provided a molecular-level understanding of the formation of various reaction intermediates and their conversion into products, which followed a complex coupling of direct dissociation and redox pathway assisted by hydrogen, simultaneously on different active sites. Thus, sophisticated manipulation of electronic properties of trimetallic sites and defect dynamics significantly enhanced catalytic performance during CO             <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>             to CO conversion.           </jats:p>", "techniques": {"output": [{"inText": "HERFD-XAS", "inPaNET": {"technique": {"label": "high resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy", "altLabel": ["HR-XPS"], "subClassOf": {"PaNET01104": "high resolution photoelectron spectroscopy", "PaNET01204": "x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy"}, "definition1": "", "definition2": ""}}}, {"inText": "EELS", "inPaNET": {"technique": {"label": "photoelectron spectroscopy", "altLabel": ["PES"], "subClassOf": {"PaNET00100": "photon probe", "PaNET01073": "obtain electronic density of occupied states", "PaNET01201": "electron spectroscopy"}, "definition1": "", "definition2": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoemission_spectroscopy"}}}, {"inText": "DFT", "inPaNET": {"technique": {"label": "serial femtosecond crystallography", "altLabel": ["SFX"], "subClassOf": {"PaNET01002": "ultrafast probe", "PaNET01003": "single shot technique", "PaNET01082": "crystallography", "PaNET01102": "x-ray single crystal diffraction"}, "definition1": "", "definition2": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_femtosecond_crystallography"}}}, {"inText": "FTIR", "inPaNET": {"technique": {"label": "fourier transform infrared spectroscopy", "altLabel": ["FTIR"], "subClassOf": {"PaNET00209": "interferometry technique", "PaNET01109": "infrared spectroscopy"}, "definition1": "", "definition2": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier-transform_infrared_spectroscopy"}}}]}}, {"doi": "10.1038/s41586-024-08292-1", "abstract": "Piezoelectric materials directly convert between electrical and mechanical energies. They are used as transducers in applications such as nano-positioning and ultrasound imaging. Improving the properties of these devices requires piezoelectric materials capable of delivering a large longitudinal strain on the application of an electric field. A large longitudinal strain of more than 1% is generally anticipated in suitably oriented single crystals of specific compositions of ferroelectric materials1. Polycrystalline piezoceramics typically show a longitudinal strain of approximately 0.2-0.4%. We demonstrate that when the thickness of a polycrystalline piezoceramic is reduced to such an extent that a large fraction of the grains are in the triaxial-biaxal crossover regime, the domain-switching fraction increases considerably. If the positive and the negative surfaces of the piezoceramic respond to electric fields symmetrically, as in the classical PbZrxTixO3, a longitudinal strain of approximately 1% can be achieved in a 0.2\u2009mm disc of the morphotropic phase boundary composition (a 300% increase from a thickness of 0.7\u2009mm). We show that oxygen vacancies in piezoceramics cause asymmetrical switching at the positive and negative surfaces, which causes thin piezoceramics to bend. We expect these findings will encourage further engineering of these mechanisms across different piezoelectric material systems, opening new applications for electromechanical actuation.", "techniques": {"output": []}}, {"doi": "10.1002/ar.25616", "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Hypercanines, or hypertrophied canines, are observed in a wide range of both extinct and extant synapsids.
