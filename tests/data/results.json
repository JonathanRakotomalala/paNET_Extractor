The obtained data reveal two sets of excitations: one set is composed of a hole in the S 3p bands and an electron excited to extended Eu 5d band states, the other is made up from a hole in the Eu 4f states and an electron in localized Eu 5d states bound to the 4f hole by its Coulomb potential. The delocalized excitations arise from the dipole-allowed 5d to 2p emissions, whereas the localized excitations result from the dipole-forbidden (quadrupole-allowed) 4f to 2p emissions. Both these emission channels have a comparable intensity thanks to a small number of occupied 5d states (approximately 0.6) combined with a large number of occupied 4f states (seven). We identify the localized electron-hole pairs with the \"magnetic excitons\" suggested in the past as an interpretation of the sharp features seen in the optical absorption spectra. Our observations provide a direct experimental evidence of these excitons which has been missing up to now.", "techniques": {"output": []}}, {"doi": "10.1039/d4an01548g", "abstract": " Synchrotron radiation micro X-ray diffraction\u2013micro X-ray fluorescence (SR \u03bcXRF\u2013\u03bcXRF) mapping explores the interaction of ammonium oxalate (AmOx) conservation treatment with the Mg-containing decayed matrix of cultural heritage fresco.
