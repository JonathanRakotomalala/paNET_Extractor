            "abstract": "<jats:p>Silica (SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) anodes are promising candidates for enhancing the energy density of next\u2010generation Li\u2010ion batteries, offering a compelling combination of high storage capacity, stable cycling performance, low cost, and sustainability. This performance stems from SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> unique lithiation mechanism, which involves its conversion to electroactive silicon (Si) and electrochemically inactive species. However, widespread adoption of SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> anodes is hindered by their slow initial lithiation. To address this, research has focused on developing electrochemical \u201cactivation protocols\u201d that involve prolonged low\u2010potential holding steps to promote SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> conversion. Despite these efforts, the complex and multi\u2010pathway nature of SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> lithiation process remains poorly understood, impeding the rational design of effective activation strategies. By introducing a multi\u2010probe characterization approach, this study reveals that, contrary to the previously proposed reaction mechanism of SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> anodes, the lithiation process initiates at low potentials with the direct formation of Li<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>SiO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> and Li<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>Si. Electrochemical activation potential was found to significantly influence the degree of conversion, with 10\u2009mV identified as the optimal cut\u2010off potential for maximizing SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> utilization. These findings provide key enablers to unlock the full potential of SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> anodes for battery technology.</jats:p>",

            "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>         <p>Colors in biominerals mainly arise from the presence of small organic pigments occluded during biomineralization processes, however the physicochemical origin of hues has been overlooked. Here, inspired by sea urchins, colored calcite crystals with biomimetic nanostructure were synthesized using the natural red pigment naphthazarin (NZ) during the formation of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), the biological precursor described in vivo. A halochromic ACC crystallization pathway is revealed, where the speciation of NZ is driven by pH variations during crystallization and subsequently stabilized within the calcium carbonate-hybrid pigments, showing lavender-blue to violet-blue hues upon crystallization. Deprotonated NZ not only leads to the various shades of blue, but also controls polymorph selection, with minimal impact on ACC formation. The resulting bio-inspired hybrid pigments exhibit enhanced color stability regarding temperature and pH as evidenced by textile finishing assays for the latter. Overall, this study brings insights into the processes behind the coloration of biomineralized organisms and explores the development of bio-inspired hybrid pigments for coloring applications.</p>",
